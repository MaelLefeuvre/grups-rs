/// Wrapper struct containing constant pedigree parameters used during pedigree simulations.
/// # Fields:
/// - `snp_downsampling_rate`: probability of ignoring an SNP position during simulations.
/// - `af_downsampling_rate` : probability of fixating an SNP position during simulations. 
/// - `seq_error_rate`       : size-two array of probability of simulating a sequencing error during simulations. (seq_error_rate\[i\] corresponds to Individual\[i\]).  
///                            This field is optional, depending on whether or not the user provided a value.
///                             - when `None` -> The user did not provide any set value.seq_error_rate is computed at each position,
///                                              using the corresponding Pileup Phred-score.
///                             - when `Some` -> The user has requested for a set sequencing error rate, across all SNP positions
/// - `contam_rate`          : probability of simulating a modern human contamination during simulations (contam_rate\[i\] corresponds to Individual\[i\])
