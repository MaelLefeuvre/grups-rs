# example pedigree definition input file
# suggestion: pairwise comparisons labels and individual IDs should be simple and not contain spaces or special characters)

# first define individuals in pedigree (each with unique ID)
INDIVIDUALS
father
mother
son
son_mate
gson
gson_mate
ggson
ggson_mate
gggson
gggson_mate
ggggson

# next define offspring relationships
RELATIONSHIPS
son=repro(father,mother)
gson=repro(son,son_mate)
ggson=repro(gson,gson_mate)
gggson=repro(ggson,ggson_mate)
ggggson=repro(gggson,gggson_mate)


# finally, define pairwise comparisons for which to calculate/output genetic distances and later perform plotting
COMPARISONS
Self=compare(father,father)       # Identical Twins or Self comparison.
First=compare(father,son)         # First Degree
Second=compare(father,gson)       # Second Degree
Third=compare(father,ggson)       # Third Degree
Fourth=compare(father,gggson)     # Fourth Degree
Fifth=compare(father,ggggson)     # Fifth Degree
Unrelated=compare(father,mother)  # Unrelated
