# example pedigree definition input file
# suggestion: pairwise comparisons labels and individual IDs should be simple and not contain spaces or special characters)

# first define individuals in pedigree (each with unique ID)
INDIVIDUALS
father      male
mother      female
son1        male
son2        male
daughter1   female
daughter2   female

# next define offspring relationships
RELATIONSHIPS
son1=repro(father,mother)
son2=repro(father,mother)
daughter1=repro(father,mother)
daughter2=repro(father,mother)


# finally, define pairwise comparisons for which to calculate/output genetic distances and later perform plotting
COMPARISONS
Father-Son=compare(father,son1)
Father-Son=compare(father,son2)
Mother-Daughter=compare(mother,daughter1)
Mother-Daughter=compare(mother,daughter2)
Mother-Son=compare(mother,son1)
Mother-Son=compare(mother,son2)
Father-Daughter=compare(father,daughter1)
Father-Daughter=compare(father,daughter2)
Brother-Sister=compare(son1,daughter1)
Brother-Sister=compare(son1,daughter2)
Brother-Sister=compare(son2,daughter1)
Brother-Sister=compare(son2,daughter2)
Sisters=compare(daughter1,daughter2)
Brothers=compare(son1,son2)
