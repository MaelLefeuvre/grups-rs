# example pedigree definition input file
# suggestion: pairwise comparisons labels and individual IDs should be simple and not contain spaces or special characters)

# first define individuals in pedigree (each with unique ID)
INDIVIDUALS
father
mother
child1
child2
wife
gchild
cousin
husband


# next define offspring relationships
RELATIONSHIPS
child1=repro(father,mother)
child2=repro(father,mother)
gchild=repro(child1,wife)
cousin=repro(child2,husband)


# finally, define pairwise comparisons for which to calculate/output genetic distances and later perform plotting
COMPARISONS
Twins_or_self=compare(father,father)      # IDENTICAL RELATIONSHIP
First_degree=compare(father,child1)       # PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP
Second_degree=compare(mother,cousin)      # GRANDPARENT-GRANDCHILD RELATIONSHIP
Third_degree=compare(cousin,gchild)       # COUSIN RELATIONSHIP
Unrelated=compare(father,mother)          # UNRELATED RELATIONSHIP
